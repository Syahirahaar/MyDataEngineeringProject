# Customer Satisfaction level towards A Airline services
This Project will show how satisfied the customer towards services provided by airline company. We can see what are the customer's concern when they took flight and how it will impact their journey. However, before giving such an insightful view to the users. We need to makesure the input since the data ingested must go through a good journey so that it can be visualized nicely. Here, I will demonstrate what are the method to make a way or path for the data to travel before it can visualized to the end customer.

# Introduction & Goals
- In order for you to understanding how it works, you need to go through the process by yourself. Here, I challenged myself to create data processing pipeline in both   method which are Batch and Stream Processing.
- Orient this section on the Table of contents
- Objective of the project :
1 . Study and understand data nature and how it can be process to make useful for the data engineer.
2 . Build Storage pipeline and use batch and Stream processing method pipeline.
3 . Experience real-life reality situation
4 . Knowing what happened behind the beautiful graphs/chart

- Write this like an executive summary
  - Passenger's rating of services provided by airline
  - The tools that will be used for this project are Python,AWS (S3,Lambda,RDS,API gateway) on atom platform
  - Tools stated above will be including along the way in the pipeline including preprocessing the data, uploading data into database, triggered lambda to run jobs.
  - Once you are finished add the conclusion here as well

# The Data Set
- Explain the data set
  The dataset chosen is about Passenger's satisfaction based on services provided. Here are the snapshot for the original verison of data, it is quite complete but stll need enrichment for further analysis. The dataset is accessed from kaggle, here is the link https://www.kaggle.com/sjleshrac/airlines-customer-satisfaction. I've attached the airline.csv in my Github folders.

- Why did you choose it?
- I'm interested to explore airline's related data. In my upcoming project, I might working with airline project. Thus, I think this is a good start for me.
- What do you like about it?
- The data is a lot, and has meaningful columns for analysis
- What is problematic?
- The data has no features that makes it unique, thus an enrichment process needed to make it self-explained.
- What do you want to do with it?
- An enrichment to the data,

# Used Tools
- Explain which tools do you use and why
- How do they work (don't go too deep into details, but add links)
- Why did you choose them
- How did you set them up

## Connect
## Buffer
## Processing
## Storage
## Visualization

# Pipelines
- Explain the pipelines for processing that you are building
